## Installation

Configuring MySQL:

```bash
create a database with your desired name
```
```bash
enter the db info into './config/db.config.js'
```
```bash
run this MySQL query to create the jhas table: 
  'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `jhas` (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    site varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    dept varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    ap varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    br varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    job varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    supervisor varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    prepared varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    date varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    steps text NOT NULL,
    training text NOT NULL,
    ppe text NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;'
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run install-client
```

Edit env:

```bash
In './client/.env' replace '10.0.0.212' with your local ip address, e.g, '192.168.1.20:5000'
```

Start the server:

```bash
$ npm run server
```

Start the client:

```bash
$ npm run client
```

Connect to app:

```bash
After starting the client scan the qr in your terminal or enter the url with the expo go app on your phone. The url should look like this: 'exp://your_local_ip:19000'
```
